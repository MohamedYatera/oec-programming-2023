Run 'activate.bat' found within the Scripts directory in the virtual environement folder you created in the last step
cd into the project folder oec-programming-2023 and install the required packages with 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

If done correctly, the user should be able to run GUI.py and interact with the graphic user interface where the user inputs their location (must be a city), age and pick the most severe symptom they are experiencing. To display the map, the user MUST input a city, then press the 'Find Facilities' button.
